Overview of Global Terrorism Data Analysis Project (1970-2017)

This comprehensive data analysis project aims to unravel insights into global terrorism, leveraging a dataset spanning the years 1970 to 2017. The dataset encompasses a diverse array of information, offering a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted landscape of terrorist activities worldwide. The primary objective of this analysis is to delve deep into the dataset, ensuring data integrity and quality through meticulous handling of missing values, outliers, and extraneous columns.

1. Key Objectives:

- Thorough Data Analysis:
  Conduct an exhaustive exploration of the terrorism dataset, considering a wide array of variables and parameters.
  
- Data Cleaning:
  Implement robust data cleaning processes to address missing values, ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the dataset.

- Outlier Identification:
 Identify and appropriately handle outliers to prevent skewed analyses and enhance the overall reliability of the insights drawn.

- Column Pruning: 
  Streamline the dataset by removing extraneous columns, focusing on retaining only the most relevant and impactful variables.


2. Insights and Findings:

- Over the period spanning from 1970 to 2017, the frequency of terrorist incidents has exhibited a noteworthy escalation, surging from 647 to 10,743 total attacks. The year 2014 marked a zenith in this trajectory, recording the highest incidence of attacks at 16,694.

- Bombing/Explosion emerged as the predominant modus operandi, constituting the most prevalent type of terrorist attack with an associated success rate of 48.62%. When considering the target type, Private Citizens & Property emerged as the primary focus, claiming the top position, followed closely by Military engagements.

- The region of Middle East & North Africa manifested the highest success rate in executing terrorist activities during this period. 

- Analyzing the geographical landscape, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan emerged as the top three nations grappling with the highest frequency of terrorist attacks.

- Within the realm of organized terrorist entities, the Taliban has proven to be the most formidable, orchestrating 11,964 attacks with a proclivity for employing explosives as their weapon of choice.


Through a meticulous and in-depth analysis, this project aims to contribute meaningful insights into the complex and evolving landscape of global terrorism. By ensuring data quality and focusing on key parameters, the findings seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trends, challenges, and nuances characterizing this critical aspect of contemporary global affairs.
